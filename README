### libtim-py: miscellaneous data manipulation utils
#### forked from [tvwerkhoven/libtim-py](https://github.com/tvwerkhoven/libtim-py); updated to Python 3 version by [danustc](https://github.com/danustc)
================================================

About
=====

This library provides some routines to work with wavefront analysis, which can
be useful for (offline) wavefront sensor data processing.

Created by Tim van Werkhoven (werkhoven@strw.leidenuniv.nl).

Installation
============

This module can be installed using the standard NumPy distutils. Therefore,
simply running

   python setup.py install

will install this module to the default installation location. Running

   python setup.py

will start an interactive installation process.

Usage
=====

Documentation of routines can be found in the docstrings of the respective 
modules. Also, running doxygen in ./doc will extract the docstrings and present nicely formatted HTML documentation.

Testing
=======

To test this module, simply run

    nosetests

from the root directory, if you have it installed. Otherwise, run the test_* 
files in libtim/

To get more information, run

    nosetests-2.7  --pdb --with-coverage --with-profile

Add the flag --processes -1 to add multiprocessing (not working on my machine)
